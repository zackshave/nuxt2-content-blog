## Professionally

I’m a front end developer with experience across a wide variety of frameworks and systems. I’ve worked with Shopify, Wordpress, Drupal, React, Vue and more. I love CSS and JavaScript most of all, but I’m comfortable with Node, PHP and Python. I customize my terminal cool stuff like Oh-my-ZSH and Starship, and I have a full understanding of modern build tools like Webpack and Vite. I’m a huge advocate for code standards through linting and automation, and I love mentoring and knowledge sharing. I work hard, and I’d like to think that I’m a kind and empathetic person to work with.

I started my web development career in 2014 when I took the Technical Web Design program at BCIT in Vancouver. Since then I have done a lot of freelancing with Shopify and Wordpress sites, as well as working for a variety of agencies doing everything from Shopify, Wordpress, Drupal and React. 

## Personally

I live in Halifax, Nova Scotia with my wife Phoebe and daughter Briar. We have a shaggy black dog named Monday, who brings me a lot of joy. I love <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zacharyshave" target="_blank">photography</a> and collecting vintage audio equipment to listen to my records on. I'm originally from Nelson, British Columbia and I've had the pleasure of living in Vancouver and Montreal before settling here in Halifax.
