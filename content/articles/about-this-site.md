## So what is it?

I decided to revamp my personal site last year and as a fun way to get up to speed on new React frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js. Initially I wanted to make a Gatsby site, because I love their image processing, but I found that event though I have a decent understanding of React, there were a lot of barriers to actually getting data into my components. I needed to add lots of plug-ins and configuration to get what I wanted out of it.
