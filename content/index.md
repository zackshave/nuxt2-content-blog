My name is Zack Shave (as you may have guessed). I'm a software developer currently focusing on front end web development. I consider myself a "framework agnostic" front end developer, having worked with a wide spectrum of different web technologies, such as Shopify, Wordpress, Drupal, React and Vue.js. 

You can see some examples of my work below.
